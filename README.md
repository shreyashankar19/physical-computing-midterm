# Midterm IoT Project

Name:  Shreya Shankar

Date: October 10, 2017

## Project: Forget Me Not

### Conceptual Description

/// This project explores the relationship users have with technology through reducing the burden people have when attempting to remember their schedules. The premise of this project is simple, it is a LED light that turns on when an assignment is due on a day. The user needs statement is as follows: 

Shreya is a student who needs a way to keep up with her daily assignments 
because she values organization and structure.

This device will be used to take the burden of remembering crucial assignments off of a person's mind so that the user will be able to tell as soon as he or she wakes up whether or not there is a remaining assignment due that has not yet been complete. In order to use technology to enhance people's daily lives, our product will solve students' problem of having to remember a packed schedule and multiple assignments by giving them an easy outlet for their memory. However, this product is not meant to replace the already existing calendar framework - it is only meant to serve as a method of remembering to check the calender.
